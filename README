The flow of the M-V-C for our application runs something like this, so far:

A client types or clicks a link containing the index route of our application.
That triggers a request to our server.js page.
The route is found in the page, which calls the function in the baseController file.
The controller calls the getNav function and awaits the result to be returned.
When the finished string is returned, it is stored in the nav variable.
The controller, then tells Express and EJS to send the index.ejs file back to the client, and send the nav string and title name-value pair along with it. These items will be used in the head.ejs and navigation.ejs partials.
The server builds the finished home page and sends it to the browser.
